                <h2>What's In a Name?</h2>
                <p>The name <i>Andes</i> is pulled from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisuyu" target="_blank">Antisuyu</a> which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua_people" target="_blank">Quechua</a> word meaning <i>East (Anti)</i> and <i>Quadrant (Suyu)</i> originally referred only to the eastern region of Inkan civilization in the Andes. The Inkans themselves referred to the Mountains as <i>Tawantinsuyu</i> or Realm of the Four Parts.

                <p>A final note is that while we're learning about the Mountains through the Inkans, Quechuas and Aymaras, there were many other groups that have own words for land they inhabit like the Mapuche, Nasa, and Kawesqar. </p>

                <h2>The <i>Wiphala</i></h2>
                <p>Each Suyu had it's own <i>Wiphala</i> to denote itself. The flag is made of a 7x7 patchwork with seven colors established diagonally. Since the time of the Inkans, The <i>wiphalas</i> have become symbols symbols of Pan-Andean pride and resistance across all the countries that include them. When traveling through each region, the wiphala will show in the bottom left corner!</p>

                <p>
                    As stated elsewhere, the information here about the Andes is pulled from Inkan civilization as its the most documented and largest sprawling culture of the Mountains. It's worth noting that alongside not emcompassing the every group of people's experience living in the Andes, the history we do have was  documented by invading and violent Europeans who filtered the history and perspective through their lens to fit their agenda. </p>
                <p>
                    We still use this information even with this caveat because due to cultural differences in how history is viewed, these documents are the most fleshed out ones we have though taking into account current Indigenous Andean perspectives is equally important.
