                <h2>Storehouses across the regions</h2>
                <p>Surplus of materials were kept in <i>colcas</i> and used to collect taxes in the form of food, clothing and other materials from the suyus before being distributed across the entire empire. Made out of stone with grass roofs, systems like this worked as a security measure in years where harvests were poor and also as a solution to the fact that Inkans did not have any way to easily transport large amounts of goods to a more central location. </p>
                <p>Items stored depended on the regions though foods included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dried potatoes</li>
                    <li>Maize</li>
                    <li><i>Ch'arki</i> (Jerky)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Cotton</h2>
                <p>
                    As with most cultures, the ability to produce clothing was extremely important and textile making played an important role in Inkan civilization being used to make tunics that showed a person's status. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Adding to this, a highly coveted wild cotton grew in the coastal valleys of <i>Contisuyu</i>. It was strong, thick and resilient, being used to make sturdy textiles, blankets, fishing nets, and ropes.

                <h2>Eight Pointed Star</h2>
                <p> What were some of the important motifs used in Andean clothing?</p>
                <p>The eight-pointed star was a symbol of rank all throughout <i>Tawantinsuyu</i> but it was especially prevalent in Contisuyu </p>
                <p>
                   This  could be due to the presence of the Chuquibamba people who lived on the coast and precended the Inkan empire.</p>
