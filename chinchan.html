                <h2>The Q'eswachaka Suspension Bridge</h2>
                <p>
                    Located on the Apurimac River and made of grasses, vines and other perishable materials, the <i>Q'eswachaka</i> is the last remaining Inka rope bridge that continues to be used to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the materials, the bridge has to be regularly maintained and local communites gather to do so every summer together as a way to honor <i>Pachamama</i> (Mother Earth) and their ansestors turning it into a day of ritual, dance and feasting. 
                </p>

                <h2>Atahualpa: The Last Inka</h2>
                <p>
                    Atahualpa was the last ruler of what was known as the Inkan Empire (with Tupac Amaru being the ruler only of the Neo-Inkan state.) Ruling from Quito in what's now Ecuador, he spent most of his rule fighting with his half brother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%C3%A1scar" target="_blank">Huascar</a> in the Inka civil war before the Spaniards arrived.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Trying to get them on his side to defeat his brother, the Spaniards would instead capture and execute Atahualpa a year after his acension and burying his body parts across the kingdom.</p>
